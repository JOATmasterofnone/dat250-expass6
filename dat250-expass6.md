# Technical Problems Encountered During Installation
The nodejs dependency was not installed so I had to install it myself.
 Version 12 was installed and then angular was installed with no warning
   then when I tried to run Angular, it complained about no having version 14, 16 or 18
   
So I manually installed 18.  I went through the tutorial on the angular website, which was
just a web of links to get lost in... I did not enjoy the tutorial nor did I think it taught me anything.  

then I tried to create a new angular project for this assignment. Then i received the same message about the incorrect nodejs version. I still don't know why.  In the end, I just installed version 12 and reinstalled version 18 again.

# Pending Issues with This Assignment That I Did Not Manage to Solve
I honestly don't understand Angular.  The tutorials where a web of links 
that didn't quite illustrate how all these pieces work together.
It isn't clear why it is necessary to have so many files create the todo list
functionality.  I am still unable to get any GUI objects displayed.
